# Contributing to CAFfeine

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CAFfeine! This project appears to be a Java-based automation tool using Selenium WebDriver for Chrome browser control.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix
4. Set up the development environment
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes thoroughly
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Environment

To contribute to CAFfeine:

- Java development knowledge
- Understanding of Selenium WebDriver
- Familiarity with Chrome automation
- Knowledge of web scraping and browser automation best practices
- Understanding of XPath selectors and web element interaction

### Setup

1. Ensure Java JDK is installed
2. Set up your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.)
3. Install Selenium dependencies (included in `lib/selenium-java-4.34.0/`)
4. Ensure Chrome browser is installed
5. Configure ChromeDriver if needed

## Project Structure

- `src/` - Java source files
- `lib/selenium-java-4.34.0/` - Selenium WebDriver library
- `*.class` - Compiled Java classes
- `run_chrome_controller.ps1` - PowerShell execution script

## Code Style and Standards

- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful class and method names
- Implement proper exception handling
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Use appropriate design patterns
- Follow object-oriented programming principles

## Selenium Best Practices

### WebDriver Management

- Properly initialize and quit WebDriver instances
- Use appropriate wait strategies (explicit waits over implicit waits)
- Handle browser crashes and timeouts gracefully
- Implement proper resource cleanup

### Element Interaction

- Use reliable locator strategies (ID > Name > CSS > XPath)
- Implement wait conditions before interacting with elements
- Handle stale element exceptions
- Use appropriate interaction methods (click, sendKeys, etc.)

### XPath and Selectors

- Write maintainable and robust XPath expressions
- Avoid fragile selectors that break easily
- Use relative XPath over absolute when possible
- Implement proper element validation

## Testing Guidelines

### Browser Automation Testing

- Test across different Chrome versions
- Handle different screen resolutions
- Test with different network conditions
- Implement proper error handling for automation failures

### Code Testing

- Write unit tests for utility methods
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Validate automation workflows end-to-end
- Implement proper logging for debugging

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure code compiles without errors
2. Test automation scripts thoroughly
3. Include clear commit messages
4. Provide detailed description of changes
5. Update documentation if needed
6. Reference any related issues

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs:

- Describe the automation issue clearly
- Include steps to reproduce
- Provide browser and system information
- Include relevant error messages or logs
- Note specific websites or pages affected
- Include screenshots if helpful

### Feature Requests

For new automation features:

- Describe the automation requirement
- Explain the use case and benefits
- Consider implementation complexity
- Discuss potential impact on existing automation
- Consider browser compatibility

## Code Review Process

All submissions are reviewed for:

- Code quality and maintainability
- Selenium best practices
- Proper error handling
- Browser compatibility
- Performance considerations
- Security implications

## Security Considerations

When working with browser automation:

- Be cautious with credential handling
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information
- Use secure methods for data input
- Consider privacy implications
- Implement proper data sanitization
- Be aware of website terms of service

## Performance Guidelines

- Minimize unnecessary browser operations
- Use efficient waiting strategies
- Optimize XPath and CSS selectors
- Consider parallel execution where appropriate
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption
- Implement proper cleanup and disposal

## Documentation

When contributing:

- Update relevant code comments
- Document new automation methods
- Include usage examples
- Update README if needed
- Document configuration requirements
